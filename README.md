## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- HTML Structure:

  - Using ordered lists (<ol>) for step-by-step instructions in a recipe.

- CSS Styling:

  - Styling lists to achieve a custom layout with gaps between numbers and text.
  - Justifying text for a clean and professional appearance.
  - Using the ::marker pseudo-element to style list numbers.

- Responsive Design:

  - Using Mobile-first approach so the coding the layouts becomes easy and clean.
  - Ensuring the recipe page looks good on different screen sizes using flexible CSS properties.
  - Understanding the importance of maintaining readability on smaller screens.

- Debugging Layout Issues:
  - Using padding, margin, and font styling to achieve a visually pleasing design.
  - Aligning text and numbers properly to create a polished, professional layout.
  - Ensuring consistent spacing and typography throughout the recipe page

### Continued development

I'll continue practice more using semantic HTML elements and implementing the Mobile-first approach.
